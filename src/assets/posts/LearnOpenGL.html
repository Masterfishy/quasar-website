<h1>Learning OpenGL</h1>
<a href="https://github.com/Masterfishy/LearnOpenGL">LearnOpenGL Repo</a>

For this project, I am learning OpenGL from <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Introduction">this tutorial</a>. Rather than targeting GLAD, however, I've decided to target WebGL because I'd like to host my projects on the web.

To compile C++ for WebAssembly and WebGL, I am using <a href="https://emscripten.org/">Emscripten</a>.

I am using Podman containers to develop and host my build artifacts. Not only did I want to learn Podman, but I liked the idea of isolating my dependencies to a container so that I can work between computers and without polluting my WSL images.

<h2>Containers</h2>
I used two development containers in this project.

The first container is the development container I use with VSCode's <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers">Dev Containers</a> extension. This creates an image based on the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/emscripten/emsdk">Emscripten image</a> and installs other dev tools.

The second container is the hosting container for the WebAssembly artifacts generated by compiling with Emscripten. This image is based off the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx">Nginx image</a> and implements hot reloading like most web development servers (Node.js, Quasar, etc.).

The hot reloading uses <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html">inotify</a> to monitor file changes in a Podman volume. The development container mounts that volume to the build folder, so when I rebuild my project in the development container, my hosting container detects the file changes relaunches the Nginx server.
